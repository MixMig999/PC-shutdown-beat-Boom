# PC-shutdown-beat-Boom
This little opensource program will shutdown your PC when some beats of song Boom Boom Boom from Vengaboys happen. <br/>
Just for Windows. But you can recreate it for Linux if you want :) (But PLS mention me) <br/>
If you have slower/faster computer, just edit Vypnout.bat with Notepad (or something else) and modify timeout 17 (the number is in seconds)<br/>
Btw some credits to azurim (his idea) <br/>
Hope, this is not bad English :P
